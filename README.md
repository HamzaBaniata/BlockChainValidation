*System Requirements:

1- Python 3.8 (First Code).

2- MySQL DataBase system (Second Code).

3-XAMPP Apatche(Second Code).



*To modify the attributes/parameters of the experiment:

1-change the mining puzzle difficaulty (at line '40' in both codes).

2-change the number of transactions per block (at line '88' OR line '118'). 

3-change the number of blocks evaluated (at line '89' OR line '119)'.

4- change the number of validators (at line '89')

5- change the total number of network nodes (at line '90')
